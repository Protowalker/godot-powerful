## Smart Audio Stream
* think a jumping audio with a duration of 1 sec but your player takes only .5s to do jumps, using the normal AudioStream it will cut the currently playing audio and start it again, with this plugin it knows if a sound is already playing and instead of cut and play again it will set another stream to play so you will hear the sounds without cutting them.

## Sound Manager 3.0
* The Sound Manager gives the users a better control over the audio of their games. Using this plugin, it is possible to play every sound of the game using just simple method calls. No more long AudioStreamPlayer lists inside your scenes nor long methods to handle the audio inside every script.
It also gives you a better control over the Background Music. The sounds will not stop between scenes anymore, giving you the power to stop it and play it whenever and however you want.

## Javascript / Typescript
* This module implements JavaScript/TypeScript language support for the godot game engine. QuickJS is used as the ECMAScript engine.
* Author: @GodotExplorer
* ![Download](https://github.com/GodotExplorer/ECMAScript)

## Kotlin
* This is a Kotlin language binding for the Godot game engine. It uses GDNative to interact with Godot's core api's. The binding provides you Godot API's as Kotlin classes, so you can write your game logic completely in Kotlin. It will be compiled into a dynamic library using Kotlin/Native. You don't have to worry about any binding logic. Just write your game scripts like you would for GDScript or C# but with all the syntactic sugar of kotlin.
